# Instructions
Please read `*.md` and start developing all aspects of this project. 
maybe advance according to the 3 phases in the readme. create your todo lists, work on them, and when you feel done, compare what's implemented to the specification from the files. Always check for compiler errors with npm run build or cargo build. 

Develop test driven. 

Feel free to extensively browse for specifications online. 

Let's go!

If there are unsecurities, accumulate them and present a batch of questions for clarification eventually. 

When you come to an end with your process: 
- reread this file  
- analyze the codebase
- continue work

## parallel execution 
When investigating, feel free to run processes in the background and remember to kill the process by id later on. 

# read ./todo file
act on open todos. More recent todos are at the top of the documents. 

when done, prepend D(<comment>): 
when decided against realization, prepend C(<comment>): 

e.g.:

becomes
- D(all passing): run tests
