Repeer is a decentralized trust network where users track their experiences with agents (sellers, services, addresses) using Present Value Return on Investment (PV-ROI) and transaction volume as trust metrics. Each user runs their own libp2p node that stores only their personal experiences, with no global consensus or data replication. When evaluating an unknown agent, users query their friend network transitively, with responses weighted by manually-set "recommender quality" factors and temporal decay. The system works through browser extensions that inject trust scores on websites like Etherscan and AliExpress, with modular adapters enabling community-driven platform support. This creates a subjective, volume-aware trust system that mirrors how humans naturally build trust through personal experience and friend recommendations, offering an alternative to centralized reputation systems.
