- contact sharing: for others to add us as trusted peers, we have to be able to send them a qr code or our libp2p id. The extension needs a tab: "me" where you can see both. our address should be click to copy.

- D(manifest.firefox.json has background.scripts configured): When adding the browser-extension/dist to firefox, we get this error:  "There was an error during the temporary add-on installation. Error details: background.service_worker is currently disabled. Add background.scripts."
- add a data field to experiences table that can be used by adapters to store any information (e.g. link to purchase, link to transaction, etc.) in json format
- what's the difference of from_peer and agent_id in cached_scores? Seems like we can remove from_peer if I'm not overlooking sth.
- D(implemented in permissions.ts with modal prompts and settings UI): I have a security concern: adapters might maliciously create experiences
  - maybe we need some kind of permission system
  - or, maybe the extension will always prompt if a experience may be created
    - and you can allow creation for a specific agent-domain/platform from a specific adapter by default
      , a checkbox "always allow experience creations by adapter x for agents on platform y"
    - add this to the readme.md
- there is so much code duplication in api.rs! explain why this is acceptable or change it

- D(comprehensive pseudocode in PSEUDOCODE.md): can you please create a minimal pseudocode translation of the whole rust application for me? 

- removed the recordNegativeExperience. negative and positive experiences don't differ in their signature. if the ROI is > 1 it's positive. But we don't have to distinguish explicitly. 

- D(warnings are for unused public methods which is acceptable for future extensibility): try to fix any warnings in cargo build / rustc - wherever reasonable
