- When adding the browser-extension/dist to firefox, we get this error:  "There was an error during the temporary add-on installation. Error details: background.service_worker is currently disabled. Add background.scripts."
- add a data field to experiences table that can be used by adapters to store any information (e.g. link to purchase, link to transaction, etc.) in json format
- what's the difference of from_peer and agent_id in cached_scores? Seems like we can remove from_peer if I'm not overlooking sth.
- I have a security concern: adapters might maliciously create experiences
  - maybe we need some kind of permission system
  - or, maybe the extension will always prompt if a experience may be created
    - and you can allow creation for a specific agent-domain/platform from a specific adapter by default
      , a checkbox "always allow experience creations by adapter x for agents on platform y"
    - add this to the readme.md
- there is so much code duplication in api.rs! explain why this is acceptable or change it

- can you please create a minimal pseudocode translation of the whole rust application for me? 

- removed the recordNegativeExperience. negative and positive experiences don't differ in their signature. if the ROI is > 1 it's positive. But we don't have to distinguish explicitly. 

- try to fix any warnings in cargo build / rustc - wherever reasonable
